# FlufflePuff_interpreter_FC_style
This is an school assignment for a FlufflePuff interpreter in a functional programming style

##FlufflePuff rules
- pf = Increment
- bl = Decrement
- b = Move memory pointer to the right
- t = Move memory pointer to the left
- ? = Asks for user input and set current memory in the ASCII value of input
- ! = Shows memory pointer to console
- *gasp* = Jump past the matching *pomf* if the cell under the pointer is 0
- *pomf* = Jump back to the matching *gasp* if the cell under the pointer is nonzero

##Implementations
- Recursion
- Map function
- Visual representation of where the code is editing the memory
- Works with nested loops
